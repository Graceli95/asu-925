# Chat History Summary

## Session Overview
**Date**: October 1, 2025  
**Project**: ASU-925 Songs API Migration  
**Main Objective**: Refactor CLI application to FastAPI and add User model

---

## Chat History

### Message 1: Initial Refactoring Request
**User Query:**
> I need to refactor this application to no longer utilize the CLI commands or any of those files. Instead, we want to leverage FastAPI to make all of our requests to our API through HTTP get, post, put & delete for all crud operations related to songs. Please adjust the code to accommodate

**AI Response Summary:**
- Created FastAPI application (`main.py`) with all CRUD endpoints
- Created Pydantic schemas (`src/schemas.py`) for request/response validation
- Updated `requirements.txt` to include FastAPI, uvicorn, and Pydantic
- Updated Song model to work with FastAPI
- Fixed import paths in database and service files
- Created `API_README.md` with comprehensive documentation
- Created `start_api.py` helper script
- Updated main `README.md` to reflect FastAPI migration

**Deliverables:**
- `main.py` - FastAPI application with 9 endpoints
- `src/schemas.py` - Pydantic validation schemas
- `API_README.md` - Complete API documentation
- `start_api.py` - Server startup script
- Updated `requirements.txt`
- Updated `README.md`

### Message 3: FastAPI Run Command
**User Query:**
> what's the syntax to run my fastAPI application in terminal

**AI Response Summary:**
- Provided 4 options to run the FastAPI application:
  1. `python start_api.py`
  2. `uvicorn main:app --reload`
  3. `python main.py`
  4. `uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload`

### Message 4: Custom Exception Handler Request
**User Query:**
> @main.py let's add a custom exception handler for when a song_id is not an int by default and explains in explicit detail what's going wrong.

**AI Response Summary:**
- Added custom exception handlers to `main.py`:
  - `validation_exception_handler` - For validation errors
  - `invalid_objectid_handler` - For invalid MongoDB ObjectId format
- Created `validate_object_id()` helper function
- Updated all song endpoints to validate ObjectId format
- Fixed type inconsistency in `get_song` endpoint
- Created `EXCEPTION_HANDLING_EXAMPLES.md` documentation

**Key Changes:**
- Lines 49-119: Custom exception handlers
- Lines 128-169: ObjectId validation helper
- Added validation to GET, PUT, DELETE, and POST /songs/{song_id} endpoints

---

### Message 5: User's Code Review
**User Query:**
> can you read this

**Context:** User had modified the exception handling code and changed approach from MongoDB ObjectId validation to integer parsing validation.

**AI Response Summary:**
- Confirmed ability to read the changes
- Identified key modifications:
  - Removed MongoDB ObjectId-related imports
  - Simplified exception handling
  - Changed `get_song` to expect `song_id: int`
  - Noted inconsistency issue with database layer expecting strings
- Offered solutions to fix type conversion issue

---

### Message 6: User Model Request
**User Query:**
> Hey I need to define a user model and I would like for it to have similar functions available to it like song does.

**AI Response Summary:**
- Initially attempted to create User model but lacked write access
- Provided complete User model code for manual copying
- Listed all features matching Song model
- Offered to help with next steps (database layer, service layer, schemas, endpoints)

---

### Message 7: Write Permission Granted
**User Query:**
> I've now given you write access to add the above python code to user.py please do this

**AI Response Summary:**
- Created `src/model/user.py` with complete User model
- Updated `src/model/__init__.py` to export User class
- Verified no linter errors
- Confirmed successful creation

**Created Files:**
- `src/model/user.py` (120 lines)

**User Model Features:**
- Core methods: `to_dict()`, `from_dict()`, `update()`, `__str__()`, `__repr__()`, `to_response()`
- User-specific methods: `get_full_name()`, `update_last_login()`, `deactivate()`, `activate()`
- Fields: username, email, first_name, last_name, created_at, updated_at, last_login, is_active, _id

---

### Message 8: Context Management Question
**User Query:**
> Is there a way I can reduce or select what context is included within this chat?

**AI Response Summary:**
- Provided 7 ways to manage context in Cursor:
  1. Clear chat history (New Chat button)
  2. @-mention specific files
  3. Pin/Unpin files
  4. Codebase indexing settings
  5. Use Composer mode (Cmd/Ctrl + I)
  6. Manually deselect context
  7. Use `.cursorignore` file
- Offered suggestions for focusing on User model work

---

### Message 9: Chat Summary Request
**User Query:**
> could you summarize this chat into a markdown file that includes a chat history of every message I've sent to you

**AI Response:**
- Created this file: `CHAT_HISTORY_SUMMARY.md`
