## Chat Log - User Messages

### Initial Request
**User**: "I need to implement a NextJS frontend application within the frontend folder that utilizes the client-server archtiecture of nextjs to operate with my python backend (in the backend folder). We need some basic user interfaces to send the requests out, I plan to provide a youtube link for the songs so we should have an embed video somewhere. Also, make sure you folow this project structure for our frontend folder:

│── src/               # Main source code  
│   ├── components/    # Reusable UI components  
│   ├── layouts/       # Layout components (Navbar, Footer, etc.)

### Clarification Questions & Answers
**Assistant**: Asked about YouTube links, UI framework, state management, and TypeScript preferences.

**User**: "1. c (just make sure it's an optional entry in any form we use)
2. c
3. a
4. b"

*Translation:*
- YouTube links: Store locally (not backend) - make optional in forms
- UI Framework: shadcn/ui (Tailwind + Radix UI components)
- State Management: Context API only
- Language: JavaScript (not TypeScript)

### Index Page Question
**User**: "in the src/pages you mention an index, what's that for?"

**Assistant**: Explained it's the landing page at root route `/` with welcome content and login/register links.

**User**: "we are good with that, but I was also curious if we are going to leverage a middleware with axios interceptors to handle the inclusion of our httponly cookies for authnetication"

**Assistant**: Explained HTTP-only cookies vs localStorage approaches.

**User**: "yes please update the plan to utilize HTTP-only cookies"

### Dark Mode Clarification
**User**: "Dark mode is not an option, it's a default"

### Implementation Confirmation
**User**: "Implement the plan as specified. To-do's from the plan have already been created, do not create them again."

### Configuration Issue
**User**: "⚠ Invalid next.config.js options detected:
 ⚠     Unrecognized key(s) in object: 'appDir' at "experimental"
 ⚠ See more info here: https://nextjs.org/docs/messages/invalid-next-config"

**Assistant**: Fixed by removing deprecated `experimental.appDir` option.

### Client Component Issue
**User**: "You're importing a component that needs useEffect. It only works in a Client Component but none of its parents are marked with "use client", so they're Server Components by default.

C:\Users\CharlesJester\Documents\Revature\ASU\asu-925\frontend\src\context\AuthContext.js:1:1"

**Assistant**: Fixed by adding `'use client'` directive to AuthContext.js.

### Dynamic Routing Request
**User**: "Can we update out application to leverage dynamic routing for our endpoints on the frontend?"

**Assistant**: Implemented dynamic routes for songs (`/songs/[id]`) and users (`/users/[username]`).

### Documentation Request
**User**: "for our @IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md can we rename to NEXTJS_INIT_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY and include a chat log of every message I've sent to you"

## Original Requirements

The user requested a NextJS frontend application with the following specifications:

1. **Framework**: NextJS with client-server architecture
2. **Integration**: Connect with existing Python FastAPI backend
3. **UI Framework**: shadcn/ui components with Tailwind CSS
4. **State Management**: Context API (not Redux/Zustand)
5. **Language**: JavaScript (not TypeScript)
6. **Authentication**: HTTP-only cookies (not localStorage)
7. **YouTube Integration**: Optional YouTube links stored locally
8. **Dark Mode**: Enabled by default
9. **Project Structure**: Specific directory organization

## Key Decisions Made

### 1. Authentication Strategy
**Decision**: Use HTTP-only cookies instead of localStorage
**Reasoning**: More secure against XSS attacks, backend already sets cookies
**Implementation**: Configured axios with `withCredentials: true`, automatic cookie handling

### 2. YouTube Link Storage
**Decision**: Store YouTube links in localStorage (not persisted to backend)
**Reasoning**: User preference for optional feature, keeps backend schema clean
**Implementation**: localStorage with keys like `song_${id}_youtube`

### 3. UI Framework Choice
**Decision**: shadcn/ui with Tailwind CSS
**Reasoning**: Modern, accessible components with consistent design system
**Implementation**: Custom components built on shadcn/ui primitives

### 4. Routing Strategy
**Decision**: App Router with dynamic routes
**Reasoning**: NextJS 14 best practices, SEO-friendly URLs, better UX
**Implementation**: Dynamic routes for songs (`/songs/[id]`) and users (`/users/[username]`)

### Authentication Flow
1. User logs in with username/email and password
2. Backend sets HTTP-only cookies (access_token, refresh_token)
3. Frontend automatically includes cookies in all requests
4. Axios interceptor handles token refresh on 401 errors
5. AuthContext manages user state and authentication status

### API Integration
- **Base URL**: `http://localhost:8000` (configurable via environment)
- **Authentication**: HTTP-only cookies with automatic refresh
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error management with user feedback
- **Loading States**: Skeleton loaders and loading indicators

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Song Management
- **CRUD Operations**: Create, read, update, delete songs
- **Search**: Debounced search by title or artist
- **YouTube Integration**: Optional video embedding with thumbnail previews
- **Form Validation**: Client-side validation matching backend requirements

### 2. User Experience
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with Tailwind CSS
- **Dark Mode**: Enabled by default with proper theming
- **Loading States**: Skeleton loaders for better perceived performance
- **Error Handling**: User-friendly error messages and recovery options

### 3. Navigation & Routing
- **Dynamic Routes**: SEO-friendly URLs for songs and user profiles
- **Deep Linking**: Bookmarkable and shareable URLs
- **Breadcrumb Navigation**: Proper back buttons and navigation flow
- **Protected Routes**: Authentication-based access control

### 4. Performance Optimizations
- **Debounced Search**: 300ms delay to reduce API calls
- **Client Components**: Proper use of 'use client' directive
- **Code Splitting**: Automatic with NextJS App Router
- **Image Optimization**: Built-in NextJS image optimization

## Configuration Files

### next.config.js
```javascript
/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {
  async rewrites() {
    return [
      {
        source: '/api/:path*',
        destination: 'http://localhost:8000/:path*',
      },
    ]
  },
}

module.exports = nextConfig
```

### tailwind.config.js
- Configured with shadcn/ui color system
- Dark mode support
- Custom animations and utilities

### package.json Dependencies
- NextJS 14 with App Router
- React 18 with hooks
- Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui
- Axios for API calls
- Lucide React for icons
- react-youtube for video embedding

## Environment Configuration

### .env.local
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
```

## Challenges Resolved

### 1. App Router Conflicts
**Issue**: Conflicting pages directory with App Router
**Solution**: Removed conflicting files and restructured to use App Router properly

### 2. Client Component Issues
**Issue**: React hooks in server components
**Solution**: Added 'use client' directive to components using hooks

### 3. NextJS Configuration Warnings
**Issue**: Deprecated experimental.appDir option
**Solution**: Removed deprecated option (stable in NextJS 14)

### 4. Authentication Integration
**Issue**: HTTP-only cookies vs localStorage decision
**Solution**: Implemented HTTP-only cookies with axios interceptors
