# I would recommend that your project is structured as an n-layer architecture.
# View layer - service layer - data layer
# We receive inputs / produce outputs on one layer of the app (CLI / API),
# We perform business rules on the service layer (EG, defining the valid years
for a song)
# We perform the actual data transformations on a data layer.
